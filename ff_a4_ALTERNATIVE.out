LE-FLOW INTERACTIONS

1: 'along boundary, S edge of field B6' from {480322, 124580}
2: 'along boundary, between fields 22a and 22' from {480452, 124407}
3: 'across path, in field 21' from {479938, 124482} to {479938, 124472}
4: 'along boundary, SE edge of field 21' from {480052, 124293}

******************************************************************************************************************************************************

SIMULATED FLOW START POINTS, PER FIELD

Flow from field B6 begins at {480336, 124886}
Not calculating start of flow for field 22, this is not a source field
Flow from field 22a begins at {480511, 124465}
For field 21, the flow start point {480056, 124608} is not within the field, so changing the flow start point to {480054, 124608}
Flow from field 21 begins at {480054, 124608}

******************************************************************************************************************************************************

SIMULATED FLOW FROM SOURCE FIELD B6

Flow from field B6 starts at {480336, 124886}

Flow from field B6 begins to flow along the boundary of field B6 at {480320, 124582} F
Flow from field B6 hit a blind pit on the boundary of field B6 at {480308, 124577}
Flow from field B6 ends at {480308, 124577}
*** Please add a field observation

******************************************************************************************************************************************************

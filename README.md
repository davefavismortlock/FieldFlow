# FieldFlow

FieldFlow is a software tool that identifies and characterise landscape elements which affect flow routing patterns in a catchment. It is a kind of preprocessor, to be run before using a catchment-scale model for soil erosion by water. A paper describing its usage has been submitted to Catena

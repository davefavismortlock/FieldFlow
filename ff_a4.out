SIMULATED FLOW START POINTS, PER FIELD

Flow from field B6 begins at {480336, 124886}
Not calculating start of flow for field 22, this is not a source field
Flow from field 22a begins at {480511, 124465}
For field 21, the flow start point {480056, 124608} is not within the field, so changing the flow start point to {480054, 124608}
Flow from field 21 begins at {480054, 124608}
